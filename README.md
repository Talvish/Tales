A service and storage framework

There were three primary objectives for this framework. I wanted service teams to a) concentrate on building core functionality, b) manage services in a consistent fashion, and c) have the freedom to tailor the framework for their specific needs.

There are a good number of capabilities of this framework and I will aspire to document and create samples for them all over time. There are also updates I would like to make given the feedback and experience of seeing it in production use over the last few years. 

This framework is one of the underpinnings of the services created at Getjar (http://www.getjar.com/). Getjar is a mobile monetization service supporting over 200 million users.

The version of this framework currently checked is in mid-update. I'm in the process of updating to support Jetty 9.x/JDK 1.7. 


A bit of history
----------------

I started building this framework in early 2011 because a) I hadnâ€™t used Java in nearly 10 years and wanted to re-familiarize myself and b) when I looked at other frameworks I found they were lacking in some areas I felt strongly about (e.g. versioned contracts). 

While most of what you see here was written in 2011 and 2012, I continue to make periodic updates.
