A service infrastructure and storage framework

The primary goal of this framework is to allows service developers/operations to get something off the ground quickly while being manageable and providing long-term depth and customization. It allows developers to concentrate on creating while operations can consistently manage whatever is created.

There are a good number of capabilities of this framework and I will aspire to document and create samples for them all over time. There are also updates I would like to make given the feedback and experience of seeing it in production use over the last few years. 

This framework is one of the underpinnings of the services created at Getjar (http://www.getjar.com/). Getjar is a mobile monetization service supporting over 200 million users.

The version of this framework currently checked is in mid-update. I'm in the process of updating to support Jetty 9.x/JDK 1.7.
