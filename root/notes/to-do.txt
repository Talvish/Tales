Multi-type contracts
-------------------------
- support the multi-type options for parameters and returns from operations
  - need to have the key, value parameters for types
  - the response object would need to be aware of the ResourceResult type to verify the type of result class works and can be cast to properly

- need to support simple type translator support where there are names that need to be used as references in the multi-type objects and in the contract

- consider adding some form of access-origin header support for resource servlet's automatically in case called by javascript
  - see: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
  - see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1653308/access-control-allow-origin-multiple-origin-domains/12414239#12414239 


CORS Support
------------
- Ease the allow side by marking the resource as CORS aware
- Verify the origin against a set of configurable origins
- Make it so that if there is any form of error of any kind and there is an Origin header that it is sets the allows header
- Don't set the allows header if there is no origin header

Cookie Support
--------------
- Use resource annotation to indicate the method parameter should be set by a cookie
- Make the cookie annotation handle not just returning the value, but the cookie itself
- Make cookies part of the ResourceResult

General Website handling
---------------
- Allow custom error handling pages
  - servlet context's have error handlers (sent in the constructor) that can be set that could potentially handle this, could 
    support a way to register a location to cover
- Allow binding websites (which could mean removing the WebsiteInterface)

Signing Support
-------------------
- fix or remove what is there

Async Support
--------------------
- Look at properly async handling and funneling



Update Admin to use Resource Contracts
------------------------------------------------
Examples:
/status/
/status/status/values/{name}
/status/interfaces/{name}
/status/interfaces/{name}/status/contracts/{name}
/status/interfaces/{name}/status/contracts/{name}/values/{name}
