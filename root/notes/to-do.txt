Multi-type contracts
-------------------------
- support the multi-type options for parameters and returns from operations
  - need to have the key, value parameters for types
  - the response object would need to be aware of the ResourceResult type to verify the type of result class works and can be cast to properly

- need to support simple type translator support where there are names that need to be used as references in the multi-type objects and in the contract
