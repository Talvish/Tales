//	// this really isn't about alerts, this is about status, but woudl be used internally as well (or externally
//	// can we maek it so the evaluation can be had both from internal data
//	// as well as from reading the data from the status pages, so we can do what we want, internal or external

//	// do we store the monitoring interval (each item can be done at differnet rates)
//
